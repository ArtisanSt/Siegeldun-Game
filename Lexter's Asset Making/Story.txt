Act 0 (Introduction):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the heart of a world full of mysteries, Two explorers ventured a vast undiscovered island.
Explorer names = (ask the user for names)

Every explorer who dared to explorer the island never came back.
One night, after settling up a camp near the shore, one of the explorers (companion) has gone missing.

The other explorer (player) packed up to find his companion.
He knows that his companion didn't disappear for nothing.
It was either because he saw something, or something saw him.

A moment later, a loud scream for help was heard in the dark forests.
The explorer picked up his knife and rushed through the forest.

He followed the footsteps and trails resembling someone being pulled until it disappeared.
One moment later, Santelmo (Fire Ball Creature) appeared and talked to him.

At first he was afraid and readied his knife to defend himself.
But Santelmo told him to not worry because he will help him find his friend.
He is the guardian of that forest and he swore an oath to protect every mankind that goes into that forest.

Santelmo told the explorer that in order to find his friend, he has to get his smell away from the tracks.
He should not leave any trail nor presence of himself in an area.
To achieve this, he has to change his clothes and leave his bag behind.
	
Santelmo then revolved around him and his clothes magically changed.
He was confused and asked where was his items.
Santelmo answered that it was in a safe place that no one will find.
He thought that he could keep his knife but it was also taken.

Santelmo told him that it also has his presence so he took it too.
But don't worry because he will have weapons along the way by the guide of Santelmo.

In the end, the Santelmo said that he can't pass through the Holy River because it is the boundary of the forest that he is guarding.
The Santelmo gave him part of his essence so that if he has questions, his essence will answer everything. (Help buttons and other help shit)
His essence will also keep him alive. Everytime he will see an Essence Shrine, his essence will bind into it to bring him to the nearest shrine when fainted. (Resurrection Shrine)

He has to pass the Holy River first and the his essence will take him to his friend.
Follow the direction of the wind and it will give him the power to kill them clean.
The only warning he gave is that do not take any Bleeding Item nor Crying Item he sees.



=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Act 1: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After crossing over the Holy River, a tall rock is seen in a distance that has symbols written around it.
The rock looks like that it was there for a long period of time because it is covered in moss.
The rock seems like it is talking to him because he can hear whispering voices telling him to touch the rock.

The moment he touched it, the rock began to have life and it lit starting from where he touched it.
Santelmo really gave him his essence. He found an Essence Shrine.
Beside the shrine is a rare dagger. (50% durability and it has less damage debuff since this is for early game)

The moment he touched the sword, its name spoke to him.
It was called, "The Ruined Dagger of the Shrine".
He felt the power hiding in the dagger for a very long time.

At that time, he felt he was ready for everything that he will face.

Hidden in the darkness are eyes that observe every move the explorer make.
Waiting for him to run

Little did he know that the cave is a den of Nightcrawlers.
These nocturnal creatures are deadly due to their sharp large claws that can penetrate through rocks.

A wrong move can kill a normal person in a second with a fast heavy leap from these creatures hidden in the darkness.
Followed with a slash of their sharp claws and bite in the neck with their shark teeth.
Santelmo's essence tells him not to move and be alert of what's coming.

After a while of waiting, the creatures got bored and started to make their move.
They made consecutive howling sounds to scare their prey and force it to panic.
But the essence and courage of the explorer made him more alert to counter any attacks that will be coming from the creatures.

A moment later, a creature that looks like a panther with eight eyes around it leap over the explorer.
With "The Ruined Dagger of the Shrine" he was holding, he countered the leap attack of one of the creatures.

The other creatures then leap after their alpha but with the fast evasion and strong counter of the explorer, killed the creatures one by one.

So in this way, a justice from killing the Queen could be served.
Its warcry angered every nightcrawler that heard it.

The explorer rushed away from the battlefield, not looking back to check if there's something following him.
When he felt tired and safe, he stopped.
Walked queitly as if he knows someone might be lurking in the forest.

In the heart of the forest lies a temple.
A temple with a dragon carved in its roof.
Positioned as if it wants to fly into the heavens but its head is gone.

In the end, the explorer will find his companion, along withother people who have gone missing.
Enclosed with blobby flesh that sucks every single blood in their body.
The "Corrupted" has been feeding off from these unconscious lifeless creatures.

When he approached his lifeless companion, it tried to reached him but he knew that
it is dangerous if it touches him while it is connected with the "Corrupted".
He cut every, "Corrupted" vessels that feeds off his friend.
But for every cut he does, his friend reacts to it.
Seems like his friend feels the pain too.

After he cut the last vessel, his friend just fell to the ground like a dead person.
No movement, no breathe, just a body without soul.

He knew that his job isn't done yet, so after he put his lifeless friend in a safe spot,
he released all of the people trapped as the life source of the "Corrupted".
Every single person he release, the "Corrupted" screams as if it knows that its life support has been cut.

A creature from a distance was heard marching towards the Crimson cave.
He knows that he will be outnumbered if he stayed.
Even though he wants to help all the people there, he has no time to take them to a safe spot.
Anyways, they were already dead when he released them.

He then fled with pulling his dead friend by him.
